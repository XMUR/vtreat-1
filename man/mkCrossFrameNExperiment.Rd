\title{Run numeric cross frame experiment.}
\usage{
mkCrossFrameNExperiment(dframe, varlist, outcomename, ..., weights = c(),
  minFraction = 0.02, smFactor = 0, rareCount = 0, rareSig = 1,
  collarProb = 0, scale = FALSE, doCollar = TRUE, splitFunction = NULL,
  ncross = 3, parallelCluster = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dframe}{Data frame to learn treatments from (training data), must have at least 1 row.}

\item{varlist}{Names of columns to treat (effective variables).}

\item{outcomename}{Name of column holding outcome variable. dframe[[outcomename]] must be only finite non-missing values and there must be a cut such that dframe[[outcomename]] is both above the cut at least twice and below the cut at least twice.}

\item{...}{no additional arguments, declared to forced named binding of later arguments}

\item{weights}{optional training weights for each row}

\item{minFraction}{optional minimum frequency a categorical level must have to be converted to an indicator column.}

\item{smFactor}{optional smoothing factor for impact coding models.}

\item{rareCount}{optional integer, suppress direct effects of level of this count or less.}

\item{rareSig}{optional numeric, suppress direct effects of level of this significance value greater.  Set to one to turn off effect.}

\item{collarProb}{what fraction of the data (pseudo-probability) to collar data at (<0.5).}

\item{scale}{optional if TRUE replace numeric variables with regression ("move to outcome-scale").}

\item{doCollar}{optional if TRUE collar numeric variables by cutting off after a tail-probability specified by collarProb during treatment design.}

\item{splitFunction}{(optional) see vtreat::buildEvalSets .}

\item{ncross}{optional scalar>=2 number of cross-validation rounds to design.}

\item{parallelCluster}{(optional) a cluster object created by package parallel or package snow}

treatment plan (for use with prepare)

\description{
Builds a \code{\link{designTreatmentsC}} treatment plan and a data frame prepared 
from \code{dframe} that is "cross" in the sense each row is treated using a treatment
plan built from a subset of dframe disjoint from the given row.
The goal is to try to and supply a method of breaking nested model bias other than splitting
into calibration, training, test sets.
