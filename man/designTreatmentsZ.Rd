\title{Design variable treatments with no outcome variable.}
\usage{
designTreatmentsZ(dframe, varlist, ..., weights = c(), rareCount = 0,
  collarProb = 0, verbose = TRUE, parallelCluster = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dframe}{Data frame to learn treatments from (training data), must have at least 1 row.}

\item{varlist}{Names of columns to treat (effective variables).}

\item{...}{no additional arguments, declared to forced named binding of later arguments}

\item{weights}{optional training weights for each row}

\item{rareCount}{optional integer, suppress direct effects of level of this count or less.}

\item{collarProb}{what fraction of the data (pseudo-probability) to collar data at (<0.5).}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE print progress.}

\item{parallelCluster}{(optional) a cluster object created by package parallel or package snow}
}
\value{
treatment plan (for use with prepare)
}
\description{
Data frame is assumed to have only atomic columns
except for dates (which are converted to numeric).
Note: each column is processed independently of all others.
}
\details{
The main fields are mostly vectors with names (all with the same names in the same order):

- vars : (character array without names) names of variables (in same order as names on the other diagnostic vectors)
- varMoves : logical TRUE if the variable varied during hold out scoring, only variables that move will be in the treated frame

See the vtreat vignette for a bit more detail and a worked example.
