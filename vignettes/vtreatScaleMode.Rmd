<code>vtreat::prepare(scale=TRUE)</code> is a variation of 
<code>vtreat::prepare()</code> intended to prepare data frames so all 
the derived input or independent (x) variables 
 are fully in outcome or dependent variable (y) units
(in the sense of a regression; categorical/logical y's are treated as 0/1 indicators)
and mean-zero.  

This is the appropriate preparation before a geometry/metric sensitive modeling step
such as principal components analysis or clustering (such as k-means clustering).

Normally (with <code>vtreat::prepare(scale=FALSE)</code>) vtreat
passes through a number of variables with minimal alteration (cleaned numerics),
builds 0/1 indicator variables for various conditions (categorical levels, 
presence of NAs, and so on), and builds some "in y-units" variables (catN, catB) that 
are in fact sub-models.  With <code>vtreat::prepare(scale=TRUE)</code> all of these 
numeric variables are then re-processed to have mean zero, and slope 1 (when possible)
when numerically regressed against the y-variable.

This is easiest to illustrate with a concrete example.

```{r exampledata}
library('vtreat')
dTrainC <- data.frame(x=c('a','a','a','b','b',NA),
                      y=c(FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE))
treatmentsC <- designTreatmentsC(dTrainC,colnames(dTrainC),'y',TRUE,
                                 verbose=FALSE)
dTrainCTreatedUnscaled <- prepare(treatmentsC,dTrainC,pruneSig=c(),scale=FALSE)
dTrainCTreatedScaled <- prepare(treatmentsC,dTrainC,pruneSig=c(),scale=TRUE)
```

The standard vtreat treated frame converts the original data from this:

```{r printorig}
print(dTrainC)
```

into this:

```{r printunscaled}
print(dTrainCTreatedUnscaled)
```

This is the "standard way" to run vtreat -- with the exception that for this example we set 
<code>pruneSig</code> to <code>NULL</code> to suppress variable pruning, instead of setting it to a value in the interval
<code>(0,1)</code>.  The principle is: vtreats inflicts the minimal possible alterations on the data, leaving as much as possible to the downstream machine learning code. This does turn out to already be a lot of alteration.  Mostly vtreat is taking only steps that are unsafe to leave for later: re-encoding of large categoricals, re-coding of aberrant values, and bulk pruning of variables.

However some procedures, in particular principal components analysis or geometric
clustering, assume all of the columns have been fully transformed.  The usual assumption ("more honored in the breach than the observance") is that the columns
are centered (mean zero) and scaled.  The non y-aware meaning of "scaled" is 
unit variance.  However, vtreat is designed to emphasize y-aware processing and we feel the y-aware sense of scaling should be: unit slope when regressed against y.  If you 
want standard scaling you can use the standard frame produced by vtreat and scale it
yourself.  If you want vtreat style y-aware scaling you (which we strongly think
is the right thing to do) you can use <code>vtreat::prepare(scale=TRUE)</code> which
produces a frame that looks like the following:

```{r printscaled}
print(dTrainCTreatedScaled)
```

First we can check the claims.  Are the variables mean-zero and slope 1 when regressed against y?

```{r check}
slopeFrame <- data.frame(varName = treatmentsC$scoreFrame$varName,
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
slopeFrame$mean <-
  vapply(dTrainCTreatedScaled[, slopeFrame$varName, drop = FALSE], mean,
         numeric(1))
slopeFrame$slope <- vapply(slopeFrame$varName,
                           function(c) {
                             lm(paste('y', c, sep = '~'),
                                data = dTrainCTreatedScaled)$coefficients[[2]]
                           },
                           numeric(1))
slopeFrame$sig <- vapply(slopeFrame$varName,
                         function(c) {
                           treatmentsC$scoreFrame[treatmentsC$scoreFrame$varName == c, 'sig']
                         },
                         numeric(1))
slopeFrame$badSlope <-
  ifelse(is.na(slopeFrame$slope), TRUE, abs(slopeFrame$slope - 1) > 1.e-8)
print(slopeFrame)
```

The above claims are true with the exception of the derived variable <code>x_lev_x.b</code>.
This is because the outcome variable <code>y</code> has identical distribution
when the original variable <code>x=='b'</code> and when <code>x!='b'</code> (on half the time in both cases).  This means <code>y</code> is perfectly independent 
of <code>x=='b'</code> and the regression slope must be zero (thus, cannot be 1).  vtreat now treats
this as needing to scale by a multiplicative factor of zero. Note also that the significance level associated with <code>x_lev_x.b</code> is large, making this variable easy to prune. The <code>varMoves</code> and significance
facts in <code>treatmentsC\$scoreFrame</code> are about the unscaled frame (where <code>x_lev_x.b</code> does in fact move).  

Previous versions of vtreat (0.5.22 and earlier) would copy variables that
could not be sensibly scaled into the treated frame unaltered.  This was considered the "most faithful"
thing to do.  However we now feel that this practice was not safe for many downstream procedures, such as principal
components analysis and geometric clustering.
